# Task-Tracker

As part of the interview process for Abercrombie and Fitch, the vendor company Information Control Company (ICC) required me to solve this code Kata. The requirements for the Kata were the following:

    1. Should load the data below into the existing data section on page load.
    2. Should have the ability to create tasks that will immediately be prepended to the list.
    3. Should not require a web server, and should be able to run offline.
    4. Match the design as close as possible.
    5. All data exchanges should be in JSON format.

IMPORTANT: This must be completed using jQuery or vanilla Javascript - no other JS frameworks may be used.  Also, do not use any CSS frameworks (e.g. BOOTSTRAP)
Without using BOOTSTRAP do styling in your own CSS with the help of SASS and make it eye catching
